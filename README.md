# Natural-Language-Processing-for-Chatbot-Analysis: Predicting Winners and Prompt Difficulty Across 20 LLMs

This project applies natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to evaluate and interpret the performance of 20 distinct chatbots and large language models (LLMs) across a diverse set of questions and responses.

The analysis began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to investigate embedded response vectors, extracting meaningful patterns and relationships within the data. To enhance our feature space and interpretability, we employed one-hot encoding for categorical variables, K-means clustering, calculated ELO ratings, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and statistical feature extraction. For performance assessment and robustness, we incorporated different types of regression testing (linear, logisitic, lasso, and ridge), confusion matrices, k-fold cross-validation, and various visualization tools (histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, box-and-whisker plots, and waterfall diagrams).

Our results demonstrated that embedded NLP features combined with statistical models can effectively predict competitive chatbot outcomes and quantify question difficulty, offering a data-driven framework for evaluating the capabilities of conversational AI systems.
